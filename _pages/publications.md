1. **Inferring nonequilibrium thermodynamics from tilted equilibrium using information-geometric Legendre transform**  
<u>Naruo Ohga</u>, Sosuke Ito, [Phys. Rev. Research **6**, 013315 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.013315)
--- [arXiv:2112.11008](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11008)<br><br>
We propose a method to infer thermodynamic quantities of nonstationary processes, which are often difficult to measure directly, from a measurement at equilibrium with external fields applied.

1. **Thermodynamic bound on spectral perturbations, with applications to oscillations and relaxation dynamics**  
Artemy Kolchinsky, <u>Naruo Ohga</u>, Sosuke Ito, [Phys. Rev. Research **6**, 013082 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.013082)
--- [arXiv:2304.01714](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01714)<br><br>
We uncover a universal thermodynamic cost (entropy production rate) to realize nonequilibrium features of the eigenvalues of the rate matrix, such as acceleration of relaxation and stochastic oscillations.

1. **Thermodynamic Bound on the Asymmetry of Cross-Correlations**   
<u>Naruo Ohga</u>, Sosuke Ito, Artemy Kolchinsky, [Phys. Rev. Lett. **131**, 077101 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.077101)

[Editors' Suggestion]
[Highlighted in [Physics Magazine Viewpoint](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/142)]
[[Press Release](https://www.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/press/2023/8610/)]<br><br>
We find a universal and quantitative relation between the asymmetry of cross-correlations, a fundamental and often-used statistic, and the cycle affinity (the strength of thermodynamic driving).

1. **Information-geometric structure for chemical thermodynamics: An explicit construction of dual affine coordinates**   
<u>Naruo Ohga</u>, Sosuke Ito, [Phys. Rev. E **106**, 044131 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.044131)
--- [arXiv:2112.13813](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13813)<br><br>
We construct an information-geometric structure behind chemical thermodynamics, strengthening the analogy between chemical and stochastic thermodynamics.

## Preprints

1. **Interplay between Standard Quantum Detailed Balance and Thermodynamically Consistent Entropy Production**  
Xin-Hai Tong, Kohei Yoshimura, Tan Van Vu, and <u>Naruo Ohga</u>, [arXiv:2512.06707](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06707)<br><br>
We relate the standard quantum detailed balance condition in mathematics for GKSL master equations and the condition for vanishing entropy production rate motivated from thermodynamics.

1. **Measuring irreversibility by counting: a random coarse-graining framework**  
Ruicheng Bao, <u>Naruo Ohga</u>, and Sosuke Ito, [arXiv:2508.11586](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11586)<br><br>
We generalize the coarse-graining of stochastic thermodynamics to incorporate a random mapping, and apply it to measuring entropy production simply by counting particles.

1. **Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra**  
<u>Naruo Ohga</u> and Takuya Hatomura, [arXiv:2505.18367](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18367)<br><br>
We significantly improve variational counterdiabatic driving for controlling quantum many-body systems by extending the algebraic characterization of the adiabatic gauge potential.

1. **Characteristic oscillations in frequency-resolved heat dissipation of linear time-delayed Langevin systems: Approach from the violation of the fluctuation–response relation**  
Xin Wang, Ruicheng Bao, <u>Naruo Ohga</u>, [arXiv:2501.01151](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01151)<br><br>
We analyze detailed structures of the heat dissipation of linear time-delayed Langevin equations using a frequency decomposition from the Harada–Sasa equality.

1. **Microscopic theory of Mpemba effects and a no-Mpemba theorem for monotone many-body systems**  
<u>Naruo Ohga</u>, Hisao Hayakawa, Sosuke Ito, [arXiv:2410.06623](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06623)<br><br>
We propose a universal microscopic understanding of Mpemba effects and develop a rigorous method for proving the absence of Mpemba effects based on the system's microscopic descriptions.

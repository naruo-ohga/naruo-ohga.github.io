We find that the asymmetry of cross-correlations, a fundamental and often-used statistic, is universally and quantitatively related to the strength of thermodynamic driving (quantified by the cycle affinity).

We find an information-geometric structure behind chemical thermodynamics, which strengthens the analogy between chemical and stochastic thermodynamics.

“Thermodynamic bound on spectral perturbations”  
[arXiv:2304.01714](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01714)<br><br>
We uncover a universal thermodynamic cost (entropy production rate) to realize nonequilibrium features of the eigenvalues of the rate matrix, such as acceleration of relaxation and the frequency of stochastic oscillations.

“Inferring nonequilibrium thermodynamics from tilted equilibrium using information-geometric Legendre transform”
[arXiv:2112.11008](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11008)<br><br>
We propose a method to infer thermodynamic quantities of nonstationary processes, which are often difficult to measure directly, from a measurement at equilibrium with external fields applied.

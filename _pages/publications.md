1. **Inferring nonequilibrium thermodynamics from tilted equilibrium using information-geometric Legendre transform**  
<u>Naruo Ohga</u>, Sosuke Ito, [Phys. Rev. Research **6**, 013315](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.013315)
--- [arXiv:2112.11008](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11008)<br><br>
We propose a method to infer thermodynamic quantities of nonstationary processes, which are often difficult to measure directly, from a measurement at equilibrium with external fields applied.

1. **Thermodynamic bound on spectral perturbations, with applications to oscillations and relaxation dynamics**  
Artemy Kolchinsky, <u>Naruo Ohga</u>, Sosuke Ito, [Phys. Rev. Research **6**, 013082](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.013082)
--- [arXiv:2304.01714](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01714)<br><br>
We uncover a universal thermodynamic cost (entropy production rate) to realize nonequilibrium features of the eigenvalues of the rate matrix such as acceleration of relaxation and stochastic oscillations.

1. **Thermodynamic Bound on the Asymmetry of Cross-Correlations**   
<u>Naruo Ohga</u>, Sosuke Ito, Artemy Kolchinsky, [Phys. Rev. Lett. **131**, 077101 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.077101)

[Editors' Suggestion]
[Highlighted in [Physics Magazine Viewpoint](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/142)]
[[Press Release](https://www.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/press/2023/8610/)]<br><br>
We find a universal and quantitative relation between the asymmetry of cross-correlations, a fundamental and often-used statistic, and the cycle affinity (the strength of thermodynamic driving).

1. **Information-geometric structure for chemical thermodynamics: An explicit construction of dual affine coordinates**   
<u>Naruo Ohga</u>, Sosuke Ito, [Phys. Rev. E **106**, 044131 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.044131)
--- [arXiv:2112.13813](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13813)<br><br>
We construct an information-geometric structure behind chemical thermodynamics, which strengthens the analogy between chemical and stochastic thermodynamics.

First-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), Graduate School of Science, the University of Tokyo. A member of the [Ito group](http://webpark2072.sakura.ne.jp/laben/).

I have interests in the theoretical aspects of **nonequilibrium thermodynamics**, including stochastic thermodynamics, quantum thermodynamics, and chemical thermodynamics. I use techniques from stochastic processes, matrix analysis, and information theory to uncover universal principles of nonequilibrium systems.
